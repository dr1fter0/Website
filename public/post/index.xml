          Welcome to my blog based on Windows, Linux and Cyber Security. I am someone who is interested in Ethical Hacking, Networks, Powershell/Coding as well as computers in general.
This aims to be a blog based on things I learn, advice I have learnt in terms of which certifications to get, if any at all and well as an aid in learning things such as Linux command line or powershell.
