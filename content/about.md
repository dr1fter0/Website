# My story
My name is Ollie, I am self taught in computing with my focus being on Ethical hacking and Cyber Security.
My knowledge of the topic is very basic, but my goal is to continue learning. Other than myself, I haven't had any direction in terms of "do this or do that" so any information I have learnt has been gathered from blog posts, people's advice and online courses/Youtube.

I started out by playing with Linux, this where I found out what a *terminal* is, from there it was a rabbit hole of customising and tweaking the operating system, but also learning the power of the a terminal without needing the use of *Graphical User Interface (GUI).* It was always something on the side because school never teaches this angle of computing, mainly just word and only recently have they introduced coding which I personally would have found really interesting. As I played with Linux more, I learned about Virtual Machines, which meant I could run different types of Linux, Windows, Mac OS and other types of operating systems on almost any computer. This got my interest as Linux Distributions (Distro's) differ due their base, which can either be *Ubunut/Debian, Redhat or Arch*.
I have explored Arch and Ubuntu/Debian however haven't got around to exploring Redhat as of yet.
It was through Linux that I learnt about *Servers* because this is where Linux is mainly used, which naturally lead to me wanting to learn about servers and what's known in the community as *homelabs*. Homelabs are servers and network components constructed by people in their own home's to server purposes such as *Network Attached Storage (NAS)* and other cool projects, such as hosting Artificial Intelligence based on open source projects, to create your *own Google home*. NAS's really caught my interest because it was something you could do yourself, host as much of your photos, movies, music etc as you wanted, the only limiting factor being storage and cost, but the cost being more proportionate to the amount of storage you want/need. Not only this, but I learnt you can Virtualise within a NAS, or you can on FreeNAS (Now known as TrueNAS). I converted an old PC, into a NAS, after installing TrueNAS on it. This required setting up IP address and configuring a static address so it sits on my home network as doesn't change. It also meant configuring some port forwarding for the domain address and installing certificates so that the connection/IP address was accessible over the internet securely so that I could access my NAS anywhere I was.
However I messed up, locked the hard drives, due to messing up the encryption on them. Despite, going into the command line to try and fix the issue, I was unsuccessful which is where I came to learn about *Encryption*
I learned about the basics of encryption and started to learn some code, Javascript, Python and HTML. Not much of the coding has stuck because I didn't really have anything to apply it too. Recently I have started investing time and focusing on Python.


## Courses that I have studied and projects
### I have tried to create an all around base in the world of computing so I can at least apply myself to most situations, even if it is at a basic level.

-> I have studied online; Basics in Wired and Wireless Network Ethical Hacking Course, The 4 volumes of StationX, Network Protocol Fundamentals.
->  In Linux I have become familiar with the command line and VIM editor too, Arch and Debian based distros, tools and how they work.
-> I started studying Comptia Network+ during in lockdown however because I went back to work, I am yet to finish that course, but still making progress.
-> I have started studying Python/Scripting to automate processes, as well as getting familiar with Windows Powershell,
-> Making this website has been really interesting because I have had to learn what different HTML and CSS functions do and how to change these variables to make the site look and do what I want. Not only that but utilising open source and new technologies to create and host the site, in order to host my portfolio.
