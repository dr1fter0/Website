## Welcome to my blog based on Windows, Linux and Cyber Security.
I am someone who is interested in **Ethical Hacking, Networks, Powershell/Coding** as well as computers in general.

This aims to be a blog based on things I learn, advice I have learnt in terms of which certifications to get, if any at all and well as an aid in learning things such as Linux command line or powershell.
