## This is going to be a blog, where I document things I learn myself and exploring the world of computing, through different platforms such as Linux, Windows and Mac OS. ##
The goal is to create a place where not only I can refer back too, but other people can seek advice and tutorials about the world of computing. I am self taught, with an interest in Cyber Security.
